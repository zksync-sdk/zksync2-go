## Expected behaviors

**Be ethical**:
We endeavor to enrich the ZKsync ecosystem, while not infringing on the rights and wellbeing of others.
We also endeavor to enrich ourselves without causing harm to the ZKsync community.
We do not encourage tax evasion, promoting information leaks, speculating on tokens or token prices, or otherwise breaking the law.

**Be kind and respectful**:
Treat everyone with kindness, empathy, and respect.
We all come from different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences,
so let's celebrate our differences and foster a culture of openness and understanding.
We may have strong feelings about other layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains,
but that is no reason to disparage, defame, or slander any competitor to ZKsync or what other chains are doing.
Feel free to compare metrics and features, but keep to the facts and be respectful of all the builders in web3
trying to advance freedom through blockchain technology!

**Share and learn**:
Our community is a space for sharing knowledge, experiences, and ideas.
Positively contribute to discussions, offer helpful feedback,

Communication is key.
Use clear and considerate language in your interactions.
We aim to create a welcoming environment for users of all ages, so please avoid excessive profanity or explicit content.

To keep our space focused and valuable, off-topic or irrelevant content may be redirected or removed.
