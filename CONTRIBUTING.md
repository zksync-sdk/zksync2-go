# Contribution

Thank you for considering helping out with the source code! We welcome contributions from anyone on the internet, and 
are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

If you'd like to contribute to project, please fork, fix, commit and send a pull request for the maintainers to 
review and merge into the main code base. If you wish to submit more complex changes though, please check up with the 
core devs first on our [Discord Server](https://join.zksync.dev/) to ensure those changes are in line with the general 
philosophy of the project and/or get some early feedback which can make both your efforts much lighter and our review and merge procedures quick 
and simple.

Please make sure your contributions adhere to our coding guidelines:

- Code must adhere to the official Go [formatting](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting) guidelines 
(i.e. uses [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/)).
- Code must be documented adhering to the official Go [commentary](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary) 
guidelines.
- Pull requests need to be based on and opened against the `main` branch.
- Commit message should follow [defined format](commit-format.md).
